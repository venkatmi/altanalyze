### Setting Python Path in Windows ###

In order to run AltAnalyze source code on a Windows operating system, you will need to set the Python PATH following installation of Python. This will allow you to type "python" in the "Command Prompt" (under "All Programs" > "Accessories") in order to call python programs. Perform the following after installing Python (e.g., Python 2.7.1).

  1. Open "Control Panel>System>Advanced System Settings>Environmental Variables"
  1. Under "System Variables" open "PATH"
  1. Append the path of python to the paths (e.g., ";C:\Python27")
  1. Select the "OK" button.
  1. Open a new Command Prompt window and type "python". Something like the following should be displayed:

`Python 2.7.1 (#1, Nov 27 2010, 12:52:40) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on Win32`

`Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.`
