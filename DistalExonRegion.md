### _What does the column "distal exon-region-ID" indicate?_ ###

_**Answer**_: The distal exon-region ID is the last annotated [exon ID](ExonRegionIDs.md) in the gene. This ID is useful in determining the relative position of the detected alternative exon in the transcript (for example, does the alternative exon occur in the last exon of the gene).
