### _What operating systems are AltAnalyze compatible with?_ ###

_**Answer**_: AltAnalyze is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux operating system. Stand-alone executable programs are available for Windows and Mac, while cross-platform source code can be easily used on Linux. Refer to the [documentation](Documentation.md) or [running AltAnalyze from Source Code page](RunningSourceCode.md) for more information.

In version 1.15, the Windows executable version of AltAnalyze built for 32bit processors but will also work on 64bit in the future. With version 1.16 and later, separate 32bit and 64bit versions will be distributed that provide better compatibility and improved system specific performance. In version 2.0, the Mac version is compiled for OSX 10.6.
