### _What is the adjusted fold versus the non-adjusted fold change?_ ###

_**Answer**_: The adjusted fold is the probeset fold change adjusted for constitutive gene expression in the experimental group versus the control. The non-adjusted fold change is the fold change of the probeset by directly comparing the average intensity of the probeset in the experimental group versus the control.
