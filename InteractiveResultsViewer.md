# AltAnalyze Interactive Results Viewer #

The AltAnalyze Interactive Results Viewer is a standalone program distributed with AltAnalyze that significantly aids in the interactive interpretation of already produced AltAnalyze results. This viewer provides an easy-to-use interface for browsing images and tables produced through the standard AltAnalyze workflows (e.g., pathways, networks, heatmaps, splice plots).
