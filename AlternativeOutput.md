The AlternativeOutput directory contains results from an alternative exon analysis. These files are typically the most informative results from an AltAnalyze analysis. These include:
  * (exon-inclusion-results) Alternative exon scores, annotations and protein/motif predictions for significant probesets
  * (exon-inclusion-GENE-results) Summarized exon scores, annotations and protein/motif predictions reported for each unique gene only
  * (ft-domain-zscores) Over-representation results for each impacted protein domain/motif
  * (microRNA-zscores) Over-representation results for each impacted protein microRNA binding site
  * (comparison-evidence) Combines junction and exon-level analyses to highlight unique exons regulated by different analyses and where independent confirmation of alternative exon expression exists.
  * (summary-results) Overview summary statistics for each analysis
  * (all-genes-comparisons-events) Combined exon results for multiple analyses in a single file
  * (all-genes-GENE-comparisons-events) Combined gene results for multiple analyses in a single file
